1. var
Scope: Variables declared with var are function-scoped. If declared outside a function, they are globally scoped.
Hoisting: var declarations are hoisted, meaning the variable is moved to the top of its scope. However, the value is not hoisted, so itâ€™s initially undefined until assigned.
Re-declaration: You can re-declare the same variable within the same scope.
javascript
Copy code
console.log(x);  // undefined (because of hoisting)
var x = 10;
console.log(x);  // 10


2. let
Scope: Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block, statement, or expression in which they are declared.
Hoisting: let is hoisted, but not initialized. Accessing the variable before the declaration results in a ReferenceError.
Re-declaration: let does not allow re-declaration in the same block scope.
javascript
Copy code
console.log(a);  // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
let a = 10;


3. const
Scope: Like let, const is also block-scoped.
Hoisting: const is hoisted but not initialized. It must be assigned a value at the time of declaration.
Re-declaration: const does not allow re-declaration or reassignment of the variable.
Mutability: While the reference to a const variable cannot be changed, if it holds an object or array, the contents of the object/array can still be modified.
javascript
Copy code
const pi = 3.14;
console.log(pi);  

pi = 4.5;        

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4);      
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
